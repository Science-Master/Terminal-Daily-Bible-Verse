# June 2018. My goal with this is to get the verse of the day.

import urllib2

import requests, json

# specify the url
quote_page = 'https://www.verseoftheday.com/'
data = []

# query the website and return the html to the variable 'page'
page = urllib2.urlopen(quote_page)

# parse the html using beautiful soup and store in variable 'soup'
soup = BeautifulSoup(page, 'html.parser')

# get the verse
name_box = soup.find('div', attrs={'class': 'bilingual-left'})
verse = name_box.text.strip() # strip() is used to remove starting and trailing

# remove the pesky unicode character -
x = verse.find(u'â€”')

# separate ref from verse
verse_ref = verse[x+1:]
verse = verse[:x]

# display verse
print "\n" + verse + "\n"
print "- " + verse_ref

# allow the user to think on the verse
time.sleep(3)
print "\nPonder. Picture. Personalize."
time.sleep(10)

# get user prayer and thoughts
thoughts = raw_input('\nJournal? [y/n] ')

    journaling = ""

    # open a csv file with append, so old data will not be erased
